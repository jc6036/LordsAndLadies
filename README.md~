LordsAndLadies
==============
Random kingdom and kingdom drama generator.
----------

Lords and ladies is written in python 3.2 for Linux, and uses the 'random' module.

----------

Due to early stages, current version number available in main.py.

TODO has a feature list, both planned and implemented.

----------

Only the kingdom generation works right now, and running the program will prompt you for a number of kingdoms and what sizes they are. Check in your 'Output' folder afterwards for the results.

This project is being dropped soon due to mass amounts of ugly and bad code, as it was a beginner's project. It is not guranteed to be started up again or finished at all.
