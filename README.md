Lords And Ladies
==============
Random kingdom and kingdom drama generator.
----------

Lords and ladies is written in python 3.2 for Linux, and uses the 'random' module.

----------

Due to early stages, current version number available in main.py.

TODO has a feature list, both planned and implemented.

----------

Only the kingdom generation works right now, and running the program will prompt you for a number of kingdoms and what sizes they are. Check in your 'Output' folder afterwards for the results.

---------

This project is being refactored due to bad organization of code. It should be up and being developed as soon as the refactor is finished.
