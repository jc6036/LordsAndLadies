LordsAndLadies
==============

Lords and Ladies is written in Python 3.2, and uses the random, tkinter, and ttk modules.
They are all required for the program to work.

----------

Due to early stages, current version number available in main.py.

Random kingdom and kingdom drama generator.

TODO has a feature list, both planned and implemented.

----------

Currently, the program is not in a workable state, and is missing several key components. After I get the resources
of all of the needed text files sorted out I'll make a basic working model of the program. For now I have placeholder
classes and functions, ready to go when the text files are in.
