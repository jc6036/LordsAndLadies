Lords And Ladies
==============
Random kingdom and kingdom drama generator.
----------

Lords and ladies is written in python 3.2 and uses the 'random' module.

TODO has a feature list, both planned and implementented.

Only the kingdom generation works right now, and running the program will prompt you for a number of kingdoms and what sizes they are. Check in your 'Output' folder afterwards for the results.

This project is being refactored due to bad organization of code. It should be up and being developed as soon as the refactor is finished.
