Finished Features:

---------------------------
CURRENT GOALS:
--After simple names are finished, flesh out locations
--After that, single-kingdom drama
--After that, multi-kingdom drama
---------------------------

Partially Done:

Random Names for everybody (still needs real text file)
Random titles
-Title function needs to be worked on
-Need placeholder title text file
Location Prefixes
-Need to get textfile up and running for this as well as get locations going
Locations -- Class needs to be expanded upon and prefixes need put in place

---------------------------

Planned features:

Random revolutions, usurping.
Random war names.
Random war between Kingdoms.
Random trade between Kingdoms.
-War and Trade will not be COMPLETELY random. IE friendly kingdoms won't have as high a chance to wage war with each other.
Multiple Kingdoms for inter-kingdom drama.
Natural disasters that befall each Kingdom.
Multiple forms of drama, including but not limited to:
-Incest
-Assassinations
-Death Due To Illness
-Death Due To Natural Disaster
-Death Due To War
-Declarations of War
-Trade Embargos
-Kingdom Pillaging
-Adultery
-Gossip

Decide on the output, whether it be text file or in-window/console.
Generate number-of-actions-per-year algorithm.
