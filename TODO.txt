Planned features:

Figure out how to include multiples of Objects within a Kingdom. Shouldn't be too hard.
Random revolutions, usurping.
Random titles as prefixes/subfixes.
Random war names.
Random war between Kingdoms.

-War and Trade will not be COMPLETELY random. IE friendly kingdoms won't have as high a chance to wage war with each other.
Multiple Kingdoms for inter-kingdom drama.
Natural disasters that befall each Kingdom.
Multiple forms of drama, including but not limited to:
-Incest
-Assassinations
-Death Due To Illness

-Declarations of War
-Trade Embargos
-Kingdom Pillaging
-Adultery
