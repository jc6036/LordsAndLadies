Finished Features:

---------------------------
CURRENT GOALS:
-Get dem text files full of names going
-Fix the code so that the files work
-Start working on single-kingdom drama

---------------------------

Partially Done:

Random names for nobility ranging from lords and ladies to kings and queens. (Done, but needs text file.)
-Male and Female names
Random Kingdom names. (Done, but needs text file.)
Random Provinces/Towns/Villages within each kingdom. (Done, but needs text file.)
-Need to set up prefixes for castles and various location types.
Random names for influential people below nobility. (Done, but needs text file.)
-Revolutionaries
-Inventors
-Those that sleep with nobility
-Those that kill nobility

Random titles as prefixes/subfixes. (Needs text file. Function is in, not implemented.)

Make it so that two locations or people can't have the same exact name.
(Function made, still needs implemented. No names the same globally.)

IMPORTANT
Implementing current set of functions and classes into a working logic-loop.
-For debugging
-For general testing

BE SURE TO spruce up the main logic after all of the text files are already added.
-As it is, the get_name function calls are only using placeholders. Expanding upon these
-must be done before the program is tested at all!!!

---------------------------

Planned features:

Random revolutions, usurping.
Random war names.
Random war between Kingdoms.
Random trade between Kingdoms.
-War and Trade will not be COMPLETELY random. IE friendly kingdoms won't have as high a chance to wage war with each other.
Multiple Kingdoms for inter-kingdom drama.
Natural disasters that befall each Kingdom.
Multiple forms of drama, including but not limited to:
-Incest
-Assassinations
-Death Due To Illness
-Death Due To Natural Disaster
-Death Due To War
-Declarations of War
-Trade Embargos
-Kingdom Pillaging
-Adultery
-Gossip
Incorporate the GUI using tkinter.
Decide on a final design for the GUI.
Decide on the output, whether it be text file or in-window/console.
Generate number-of-actions-per-year algorithm.

Basic User Input: Number of kingdoms, Number of years of drama to generate.
-Possible expansion on user definitions after everything is done.
-More customization for the kingdoms/drama, or insertions of specific names by user.
