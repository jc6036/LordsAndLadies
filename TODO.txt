Multiple forms of drama, including but not limited to:
-Incest
-Assassinations
-Death Due To Illness

-Declarations of War
-Trade Embargos
-Kingdom Pillaging

Basic User Input: Number of kingdoms, Name of kingdoms, Number of years of drama to generate.
-Possible expansion on user definitions after everything is done.
